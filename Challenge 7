Exercise 7 (and Solution)

Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: 
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

Challenge 7
#In case the new value needs to be stored in a variable.
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
b = []
for num in a:
    if num % 2 == 0: b.append(num)
print(b)
------------------------------------------
#In case it doesn't.
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
print([n for n in a if n % 2 == 0])
