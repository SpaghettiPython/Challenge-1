Exercise 14 (and Solution)

Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

Extras:

    Write two different functions to do this - one using a loop and constructing a list, and another using sets.
    Go back and do Exercise 5 using sets, and write the solution for that in a different function.

def dupplicateS(l):
    l = set(l)
    print(l)
def dupplicateL(l):
    newL = []
    for i in l:
        if i not in newL:
            newL.append(i)
    print(newL)
l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8 , 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
dupplicateS(l)
dupplicateL(l)
