Exercise 1 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them 
the year that they will turn 100 years old.

Extras:

   Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and printing out that many copies of the previous message.
   (Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
   Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
   (Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)

#Ask the user for his name and age
name = input("Please enter your name: ")
age = (int(input("Please enter your age {}: ".format(name))))


years = 100 - age
date = 2018 + years

msg = ("Hi {}, you will be 100 in {} years, and the year will be {} \n ".format(name, years, date))
num = int(input("Would you mind giving me a random number?\n"))
msg += "\n"
print(num * msg)
