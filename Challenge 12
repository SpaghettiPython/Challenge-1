Exercise 12 (and Solution)

Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) 
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
For practice, write this code inside a function.

import random
def first_and_last():
    a = random.sample(range(10), 10)
    b = a[0]
    c = a[-1]
    print(a)
    e = print("The first and last numbers in the list are {} and {}".format(b, c))
    print(e)
first_and_last()
