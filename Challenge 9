Exercise 9 (and Solution)

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, 
then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. 
(Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras:

    Keep the game going until the user types “exit” (I made this part my own.)
    Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


import random
import sys
def guessing_game():
    number = random.randint(1, 9)
    guess = int(input("Enter an number from 1 to 9:\n"))
    while number != "guess":
        if guess > number:
            print("Try a lower number\n")
            guess = int(input("Please guess a number between 1 and {}\n".format(guess)))
        elif guess < number:
            print("Try a higher number\n")
            guess = int(input("Please guess a number between {} and 9\n".format(guess)))
        else:
                print("YOU ARE CORRECT!!!")
                p_again = input("Would you like to play again?\nType in yes or no:\n")
                if p_again == "yes":
                    guessing_game()
                else:
                    sys.exit(print("Ok then, have a nice day."))
guessing_game()
