Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

def isPalindrome(s):
    reverse = "".join(reversed(s))
    if (s == reverse): return True
    return False

s = input("Type a word to find out if its a palindrome or not:\n")
answer = isPalindrome(s)

if (answer):
    print("Yes, this word is a palindrome")
else:
    print("No, this is not a palindrome")
