Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), 
compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

    Rock beats scissors
    Scissors beats paper
    Paper beats rock

import sys
print("Hey there, this is a Rock-Paper-Scissors Game.\nEnter rock, paper, or scissors to make your choice.\n"
      "Remember, you can type stop, to exit the game at any time.")
rules = {"rock": {"scissors": "Player 1 wins", "paper": "player 2 wins", "rock": "It's a draw"},
         "paper": {"scissors": "Player 2 wins", "rock": "Player 1 wins", "paper": "It's a draw"},
         "scissors": {"rock": "Player 2 wins", "paper": "Player 1 wins", "scissors": "It's a draw"}}
while True:
    a = input("Player 1, What is your choice?\n")
    b = input("Player 2, What is your choice?\n")
    print(rules[a][b])
    play_again = input("Would you like to play again?\nYes or No:\n")
    if play_again == "yes":
        continue
    else:
        sys.exit(print("Have a nice day."))
