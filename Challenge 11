Exercise 11 (and Solution)

Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. 
(For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.) 
You can (and should!) use your answer to Exercise 4 to help you. 

import sys
def pr_or_not():
    number = int(input("Can you give me a number please\n"))
    if number == 2:
        sys.exit(print("2 is a prime number"))
    if number >= 1:
        for i in range(2,number):
            if number % i == 0:
                print(number, "is not a prime number")
                print(i, "times", number // i, "is", number)
                break
            else:
                print(number, "is a prime number")
                break

    else:
        print(number, "is not a prime number")

pr_or_not()
