Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 
Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

    If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
    Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). 
    If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

Challenge #2
def numCheck(a,b):
    if (check / num) % 2 == 0:
        print("{} can be divided by {} and the result is an even number".format(check, num))
    elif (num % 4) == 0:
        print("{} is a multiple of 4".format(num))
    elif (num % 2) == 0:
        print("{} is even".format(num))
    else:
        print("{} is odd".format(num))

num = int(input("Hey there, can you give me a random number please?\n"))
check = int(input("Now can you give me a second number please?\n"))
ans = numCheck(num,check)
