Exercise 15 (and Solution)

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

  My name is Michele

Then I would see the string:

  Michele is name My

a = "My name is Eddie"
b = a.split()
c = " ".join(reversed(b))
print(c)
